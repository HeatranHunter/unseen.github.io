    <h1>My Overview on YHWH's Divine Council</h1>
    <h3>Biblical Evidence for the existance of a Divine Council and the Sons of God</h3>
    <li>
        <span><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Psalm82:1-2,6-8&version=ESV">Psalms 82:1-2, 6-8</a>
            Shows the existance of some sort of <strong>divine council</strong> made up of <em>elohim</em> that judge on the 
            earth unjustly and show partiality to the wicked. We can now exclude the idea of this council being the Trinity, 
            any group of men, and any angels that are obediant to God. We must be talking about fallen angels, fallen 
            <em>elohim</em>. We also know, from verses 6 and 7, that this council is refered to as the <em><strong>sons of 
            the Most High</strong></em>. But, that these sons will die just like men, and that God will inherit the earth. 
            This means that God does not already own the earth in a sense, but that it will become his. More on that later.

        <span><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Psalm89:5-8&version=ESV">Psalms 89:5-8</a> The
            <strong>"assembly/council of the holy ones"</strong> could also lend itself to the evidence of a divine council. 
            Scripture also makes it clear that none of these are anything like God. He is the only one like Himself. He is 
            the only creator, and they are all created by Him.</span>

    <li>
        <span><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Job+1%3A6%2C+2%3A1&version=ESV">Job 1:6, 2:1</a> These 
            verses say basically the same thing at different points. It talks about the sons of God presenting themselves 
            before the Lord. And then, Satan shows up. Satan here, whether being the serpent in the garden or an elohim 
            with a job as the Satan (as the word satan only means 'accuser' and never is used in the old testament to refer 
            to the serpent), his role is the same. He goes to find people to accuse of sin. This is a spiritual job, meaning 
            this is a meeting of spirits, not of men. Therefore, the sons of God are again referring to the elohim on his 
            divine council.

    <li>
        <span><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Job+38%3A4-7&version=ESV">Job 38:4-7</a> Now we see the 
            sons of God as being at the creation of the world. The sons of God, being the divine council, witnessed the 
            creation of the world from the viewpoint of heaven (most likely). The morning stars are normally, in scripture 
            and in other historical texts, referring to angels or gods. In scripture, the morning star is first Lucifer and 
            then Jesus. The point is the same. Spiritual beings are referred to as the morning star, so we can rightly 
            assume that the ones who witnessed creation was God's entire heavenly host, both his council and/or, his angels.

    <li>
        <span><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis+6%3A2-4&version=ESV">Genesis 6:2-4</a> This 
            verse says a few things, and has a few characters. First, we have the <strong>the sons of God</strong>. As 
            we've established, these sons of God are most likely the angels, the divine council. However, there is another 
            interpretation (despite the previous verses) of these sons being the <strong>line of Seth</strong>. The 
            reasoning behind this is in the fact that up to this point in Genesis, the only two important lines are that of 
            Cain and Seth. And sometimes, the line of Seth is referred to as <em>God's sons</em> (Duet. 14:1, Jer. 3:19), 
            but never explicitly as the 'sons of God'. This view could be reasonable, but because of all the rest of the 
            biblical evidence as the sons of God being the angels, the <em>elohim</em>, we must take this view into account 
            as well. Now, Matthew 22:30 is often used as evidence that Genesis must not be talking about the fallen angels, 
            because the angels in heaven do not marry or have relationships like humans do on earth. However, if one were 
            to invalidate this view because of this verse in Matthew, they would also have to invalidate 1 Peter 3:19-20 
            and Jude 5-7. Peter makes his point by referencing the event of the disobedient angels at the time right before 
            Noah's ark. Jude makes his point by referencing a similar event where the angels sinned, adds some information 
            that those angels are locked up, and relates them to the sexual sins of Sodom and Gomorrah. And, because of how 
            similar Jude and 1 Peter 3 are, we could make an educated guess that these two events are one in the same. The 
            angels committed a sexual sin with the human daughters and have been locked up for their sin, waiting for the 
            final judgment day. This seems to be contradictory to Matthew 22:30, but that verse speaks of the angels in 
            heaven. These angels (the ones that sinned) are not in heaven, but are instead in chains under gloomy darkness. 
            We can reconcile these verses by saying that the angels obedient to God do not commit any relationships, they 
            are not meant to. But, that doesn't mean that they can't, as we see of these angels in Genesis. <br>
            &ensp;&ensp; Another argument to say that these angels <em>could not</em> have sexually sinned is that angels 
            are spirits. They cannot do anything physical because they themselves are not physical beings. Direct your 
            attention now to Genesis 19:3, where the text says that the angels that came to protect Lot and his family 
            <em>ate</em> with Lot. This presumes that angels can indeed do human activities, like eating, and with that, 
            like sexual acts of sin. If that isn't convincing, I also bring up Mark 5:1-20 and John 13:27. These two 
            scriptures both tell how demons and Satan can enter into people to do their bidding. If these are true, then we 
            could also say that maybe the fallen angels possessed certain men to come into the women. The text doesn't say 
            that, but it could be another interpretation. <br>
            &ensp;&ensp; What the text does make absolutely clear is that it was the angels who are the sons of God in 
            Genesis 6. The line of Seth is a newer interpretation, while the fallen angels seems to be the interpretation 
            of the old/new testament writers and the early church. In conclusion, while the sons of God being the line of 
            Seth has some sort of a foundation, scripture has more evidence for the sons of God being the fallen angels, 
            and very likely, elohim on God's divine council.
            <br><br>
            &ensp;&ensp; The next characters we have are the <strong>Nephilim</strong>. In the Hebrew text, this is 
            translated as 'Giant'. However, this could be a mistranslation. Another known translation for Nephilim is 
            “fallen one”. And no, not the fallen angels. But instead, it is used to describe fallen warriors, men who had 
            died in battle. Many other extra biblical ancient texts use this word to describe great heroes, such as 
            Gilgamesh, Hercules, and other demigods. Isn't it interesting? That this word Nephilim is used elsewhere to 
            describe the children (heroes) of both gods and women? This could very well be pointing to the idea that it was 
            in fact the angels who had relations with the women, and the nephilim, not giants, but warriors, were their 
            children. Even with this understanding, however, the text is oddly worded so that it's difficult to understand 
            <em>exactly</em> who the Nephilim are. They could be the children of the sons of God and the daughters of man, 
            or they could be completely unrelated, and only used as a reference point for which era these events took place. 
            However, it seems to be a better understanding that fits well if they are the children of the Angels and women.
            <br><br>
            &ensp;&ensp; Now, we come to the <strong>Mighty men</strong>, the men of renown. Whether these are the same as 
            the Nephilim or not, the text, as stated previously, makes it somewhat hard to understand. Nevertheless, the 
            text is clear that the mighty men <em>are</em> the children of the sons of God and the daughters of man. And, 
            as stated earlier, these are most likely the 'demigods' of ancient extra biblical text, such as Gilgamesh, 
            Hercules, etc. To say that these sons of God are just the line of Seth takes away from the greater meaning 
            of the spiritual understanding of the ancient world, and just doesn't fit into the story of the bible as well.

    <h3>The Event of the Tower of Babel</h3>
    <li>
        <span><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis+11%3A4-9&version=ESV">Genesis 11:4-9</a> Here we 
            see the famous account of the tower of Babel. It says that as people began to grow in their numbers, they all 
            came to live in one place, in one city, with one mindset: To make for themselves a name so as not to be 
            dispersed by building a tower to the realm of the gods, the heavens. However, we see that the Lord comes down 
            to see what they are doing and sees the blasphemous tower they've built, so he confuses their language and 
            disperses them across the earth, the very thing they didn't want to happen. In a minute, we'll see what the 
            implications of that event is.
        </span>
    </li><br>
    <li>
        <span><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Deuteronomy+32%3A8-9&version=ESV">Deuteronomy 32:8-9</a> 
            Now in this verse, it speaks of the Most High (the Lord) dividing mankind (at the event of Babel) and giving 
            them (the newly divided nations) over to the sons of God. The only exception being <em>Israel</em>, the Lord's 
            inheritance. This means that God has given over the other nations as his inheritance to the sons of God to be 
            their inheritance. God, in a sense, no longer owns the other nations. Doesn't this sound familiar? In Psalms 
            82:6-8, we saw this exact idea, that the Lord did not exactly own the other nations. God has given the other 
            nations to the members of the divine council, but he kept Israel as his own.
        </span>
    </li>
    <h3>How this all connects to Christ</h3>
    <li>
        <span><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Psalm+2%3A7-9&version=ESV">Psalms 2:7-9</a> This verse 
            speaks of a 'Son of God' but not in the way we've seen before. In the previous verses, we've seen the 'sons of 
            God' used to speak of the angels of God's divine council. But this is much different, because he uses the word 
            <em>begotten</em>. In a human understanding, to beget someone is normally referring to a man being the 
            biological father of his son. Of the same essence as himself. The son came from the father. Obviously, God the 
            Father could not have literally begotten the Son of God, because there is no point in or outside of time where 
            the Father was without the Son, for they have always been in perfect union together. However, begotten lets us 
            know that the Father and the Son are of the same essence. The only Son of God who is like God himself. This Son 
            is Jesus Christ. And to Christ belongs the nations. Just as we see that God will take the nations back in 
            Psalms 82, he's giving them to Christ to rule.
        </span>
    </li>
    <li>
        <span><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ephesians+6%3A12&version=ESV">Ephesians 6:12</a> This 
            verse makes a certain reality clear to us. Our real fight isn't with people, but with the evil spiritual forces 
            that are at war with God and his people. The sons of God that judge unjustly, show partiality to the wicked, 
            the prince of the power of the air, these are the forces we are at war with. Paul uses the war and armor imagery 
            to help us understand the reality of what's going on. He goes on to prepare us on how to defend ourselves 
            <em>spiritually</em>. And our defense is rooted in the character of Christ Jesus. The belt of truth, breastplate 
            of righteousness, shield of faith, all only possible because of the finished work of Christ.
        </span>
    </li>
    <h3>Conclusion</h3>
        <p>&ensp;&ensp; Our war with the evil spirits, however, will not go on forever. Revelation 11:15 clearly states this 
        truth: <em>"Then the seventh angel blew his trumpet, and there were loud voices in heaven, saying, 'The kingdom of 
        the world has become the kingdom of our Lord and of his Christ, and he shall reign forever and ever.'"</em> The 
        war will end, Christ will win, and he'll do it on our behalf. And not only that, but we, as the newly adopted 
        sons of God (Gal. 4:4-7), will inherit and rule the earth with him (Matt. 5:1-12). Understanding the sons of God 
        and the divine council doesn't deter our attention from Jesus, but it makes our hope even greater. Knowing that 
        against all odds, against the angels and against the gods all over the earth, Christ will win the war for us, 
        and he will never be dethroned, and his kingdom shall reign forever and ever, amen!</p>
